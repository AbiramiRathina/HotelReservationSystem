# Hotel Reservation System in Java
The Online Hotel Booking System is a project implemented for allowing users to
book hotels. The user can log onto the application using their existing
account. Otherwise the user can create an account by giving the necessary details. After creation of the account, the user can now log into the application. The user can
register either as an admin or an user. As an admin the person can add new hotels to
the list of hotels and as a user the person can view the listed hotels and can book a
hotel. Both the admin and the user are provided with different login pages to facilitate
secured access to the functions of the application. The admin/user can rechange the
password on clicking the forgot password button. The user can sign out from the
application when he is done using the app.
